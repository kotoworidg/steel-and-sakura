## 2026-10-21: native Suppression Fire R2 installed with user approval

The user approved the temporary shared native-ability override. Installed hash:
`1737D02D67F0C9100BBCC5255057C12B532F9805482D18ADC910542653D96DCD`.
Oda ranged infantry: **TYPE20 SUPPRESSION FIX R2**; expected native button:
**Suppression Fire**, configured for 30 seconds active / 120 seconds recharge.
Backups and installed/build hash checks completed; loading files unchanged.
Button visibility, activation and firing behavior await gameplay confirmation.
Animations and firing statistics were not changed in R2. Other native Suppression
Fire users receive the approved shared projectile/unlock behavior while enabled.
Rollback: `python scripts/type20_native_suppression.py rollback`.
Exact installation/backup record: `build/type20-native-suppression/installation.json`.
Earlier prepared/not-installed statements below are historical.

## 2026-10-21: dummy ability failed; native-key R2 built, not installed

User reports no Suppressive Fire button and only the existing paired firing.
Do not count the preceding build as a working ability or continuous fire.
[Native R2 report](docs/TYPE20_NATIVE_SUPPRESSION_FIX.md) gives the exact fix:
real suppression_fire assignment, native button unlock, and private projectile
relink. This uses shared native definitions and awaits explicit shared-scope
approval before installation. Animations and firing statistics are unchanged.
The current installed pack remains the preceding build until approval/install.

## 2026-10-21: single-button Suppressive Fire test installed — runtime pending

Latest report: [TYPE20_SUPPRESSION_TEST.md](docs/TYPE20_SUPPRESSION_TEST.md).
New Oda ranged infantry: **TYPE20 SUPPRESSIVE AUTO TEST**, intended button
**Suppressive Fire**. Tests an unused registered engine identity, private activated
projectile and two-shot 0.10-second timing. Longer individual bursts and continuous
fire remain unconfirmed. The user confirmed the previous unit fires paired shots
without a reload animation; all 60 preceding payloads remain byte-identical.
Artillery, grenades and vanilla Suppression Fire are unchanged.
Build/install: `powershell -File scripts/build_type20_suppression.ps1 -Install`.
Rollback to the preceding confirmed behavior: `python scripts/type20_suppression.py rollback`.

## 2026-10-21: separate automatic-cycle trial installed; runtime pending

See [TYPE20_AUTO_CYCLE.md](docs/TYPE20_AUTO_CYCLE.md) for evidence, exact changes,
validation, installation, rollback and gameplay test. New Oda ranged infantry:
**TYPE20 AUTO CYCLE TEST - continuous trial**. The user-confirmed
**TYPE20 BURST TEST - two timed shots** remains available unchanged alongside it.
The new unit combines a 0.30-second two-event firing clip, short aimed recovery
states, and an experimental zero projectile reload timer. Continuous fire is not
confirmed. All 39 prior payloads are byte-identical. Artillery and grenades unchanged.
Build/install: `powershell -File scripts/build_type20_auto_cycle.ps1 -Install`.
Restore confirmed burst build: `python scripts/type20_auto_cycle.py rollback`.

## 2026-10-21: isolated Type 20 burst test installed — runtime unconfirmed

Current instructions and engine evidence: [TYPE20_BURST_TEST.md](docs/TYPE20_BURST_TEST.md).
Oda ranged infantry: **TYPE20 BURST TEST - two timed shots**. Unique registry,
two timed events 0.15 s apart, repeated source recoil poses, and aimed recovery.
Combat DB statistics and all 20 working fallback payloads are unchanged.
No sustained automatic-fire success is claimed. The previous path control was
inconclusive. Build/validate/install: `powershell -File scripts/build_type20_burst.ps1 -Install`.
Rollback: `python scripts/type20_burst.py rollback`. See the report for exact
installed hash, backup record and short gameplay test. Historical entries follow.

> Current result: the user tested the separate Type 20 unit and reports no automatic fire. The two-event experiment failed its gameplay objective. A one-shot animation-path control is now installed; see [TYPE20_PATH_CONTROL.md](docs/TYPE20_PATH_CONTROL.md). Historical build details below are retained.

# Current Type 20 research status

2026-10-21: the research pass found real numbered human firing events.
See [technical report](docs/TYPE20_RESEARCH.md) and
[test checklist](tests/type20-event-test.md).

Installed: data/steel_sakura_combined_test.pack, with the new separate
Steel & Sakura Type 20 Automatic Fire Test alongside the unchanged riflemen.
This is an unconfirmed two-event experiment, not working automatic fire.
All original rifle, grenade, artillery and recruitment pack payloads are preserved.

## Active engine diagnostic V1 - 2026-10-21

Both units were visible, but no custom buttons and no modern combat behavior
were observed. The previous custom UI experiment failed. Current diagnostic uses
separate normal combat projectile/gun keys and supported vanilla Blinding Grenades
and Shrapnel Shot buttons with vanilla special ammunition unchanged. One temporary
grenade technology-unlock flag affects vanilla ninjas while enabled. See
[combat diagnostic and low-FPS test](docs/COMBAT_DIAGNOSTIC.md). Rebuild with
scripts/build_combat_diagnostic.ps1. Milestone remains PENDING_USER_CONFIRMATION.

## Combined correction - 2026-10-21

Use scripts/build_combined.ps1 and scripts/install_combined.py. Install directly
into game data; older MyMods notes are superseded. Test Oda gun infantry and
siege/artillery. Both units/buttons require user confirmation. See
docs/COMBINED_TEST.md and INSTALL.md.

# Test plan when a GPU is available

## Offline verification now

Run `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/build.ps1`. It prepares local rows, builds and reopens the pack with RPFM, runs `scripts/validate_offline.py`, and executes Python regression tests. The generated report is `build/validation/offline-report.json`. Static checks do not prove gameplay.

## In-game infantry acceptance

Use a disposable new Sengoku campaign and keep existing saves untouched. Record game executable/runtime version, selected unit-size setting, enabled mod list, screenshots or video, and any crash logs.

1. Confirm the campaign loads and existing factions/buildings appear normally.
2. Check a Japanese faction's Fort recruitment panel for Automatic Rifle Squad. Record cost, availability, text, icon, and whether recruitment completes.
3. Deploy it in battle and count soldiers at the selected unit-size setting; the DB target is 40, but unit-size scaling may affect observed count.
4. Observe model/equipment, movement, ranged attack, reload timing, ammunition, accuracy, morale, sound, and crash/stall behavior. Compare to a FoTS repeating rifle unit; do not call the fire mode automatic without observed evidence.
5. Check custom-battle selection separately. Record absence as a defect rather than assuming campaign permission covers it.
6. Test with the existing Otomo mod enabled and disabled to isolate conflicts. Preserve both mod-list configurations.

## Tank and aircraft gates

For tank research, `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/build.ps1 -ArtilleryTest` creates a separate pack in `build/`. Back up `mod_list.txt` before any temporary installation. Test whether the dormant limbered gun recruits from a Sengoku Fort and capture actual movement, collision, aim/firing, and crew behavior. Remove the research pack after testing. A horse-drawn gun does not pass the Chi-Ha acceptance gate. For aircraft, require on-screen 3D geometry continuously above the battlefield, verified movement/animation and meaningful game control or scripted behavior. An off-map strike or projectile does not pass.
